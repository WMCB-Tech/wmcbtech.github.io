<h1>About this page</h1>

<p>This page is hosted at my GitHub Repository, please don't expect this site will be modern (Becuz, i'm too lazy to do so =P, feel free to make a PR)
And i could use this to host my APT repository</p>

<p>If you want to improve this, PR's are welcome and soon i might use Jekyll but HTML would be preferred for now
And i just want to share myself</p>
