<h1>Hello There ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>My name is WMCB Tech (marcusz) and i am a linux lover</p>

<p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/65075766?s=460&amp;u=d0893e0085eab22466843e41c28144c675895e8d&amp;v=4" alt="avatar" title="" /></p>

<p>So i'm currently working in these projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>DebDroid (The Universal Debian Installer for Android without root)</p></li>
<li><p>rlchroot (Gives an LXC Like Experience inspired by udocker)</p></li>
<li><p>Termux in Alternate Userspace</p></li>
<li><p>Systemd for WSL (Currently working on it)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As you see i mostly use WSL and Termux and i might get myself a PinePhone for just VS Code</p>

<ul>
<li><p>And also subscribe to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/WMCB-Tech">Youtube</a> Channel</p></li>
<li><p>Follow Me on <a href="https://twitter.com/wmcbtech30">Twitter</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>And i also have my Discord Server to join (Just for a good tech talks):</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm just a regular user who do tech stuff and also taking intrest about computer security and programming</p>

<p>And i have a wide interest about Virtualization, my Favorite is Docker and LXC for my Containers
But mostly i use Chroot</p>

<p>About me, i'm also a YouTuber wanted to share stuff about tech, unfortunately i couldn't process your comments and your video requests but good motives will cheer me up ðŸ™‚<p>
<br>
<p>I also hoped that we could reach atleast 1000 subs</p>

<p>Right now i'm busy, but i can answer your comments, and i'm also active at discord hanging out</p>

<p>During the quarantine i might have free time doing stuff and to make quality content videos</p>

<h1>About this page</h1>

<p>This page is hosted at my GitHub Repository, please don't expect this site will be modern
And i could use this to host my APT repository</p>

<p>If you want to improve this, PR's are welcome and soon i might use Jekyll but HTML would be preferred for now
And i just want to share myself</p>
